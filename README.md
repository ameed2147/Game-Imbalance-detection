## Project Overview
This project focuses on using **machine learning** techniques to enhance game balancing in **competitive multiplayer games**, specifically **Dota 2**. The objective is to detect and address gameplay imbalances by analyzing large datasets of match data, providing valuable insights for game developers to improve **player experience** and **retention**.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Utilized the **OpenDota API** to collect data from over **10,000 Dota 2 matches**.
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - **Logistic Regression** for detecting gameplay imbalances.
  - **Random Forest** and **Gradient Boosting** for evaluating feature importance.
  - **Isolation Forest** for identifying anomalies in hero performance and item usage.
- **Key Metrics**: Analyzed factors like **KDA ratio**, **win rate**, **hero combinations**, and **item builds** to highlight significant gameplay imbalances.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Detected outlier heroes and items that showed abnormal performance, helping improve game balance.
